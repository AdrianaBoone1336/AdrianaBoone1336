## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository focused on research and experimentation in multi-modal machine learning and data fusion. This space serves as a hub for exploring how diverse data typesâ€”such as text, images, audio, and structured inputsâ€”can be combined to build more robust, context-aware models.

As a machine learning researcher, my primary interest lies in developing and analyzing systems that can process and integrate multiple modalities of data. Multi-modal models are increasingly important in real-world applications like visual question answering, medical diagnostics, sentiment analysis, and autonomous systems, where understanding the interplay between different data types is crucial for accurate and reliable outcomes.

In this repository, youâ€™ll find research prototypes, model architectures, data preprocessing pipelines, and experiments focused on fusion strategiesâ€”ranging from early and late fusion to more complex attention-based and transformer-based integration methods. I often work with frameworks such as PyTorch and Hugging Face Transformers, and use datasets that span across modalities to test generalization and alignment.

Documentation and notes accompany most projects, explaining the goals of each experiment, the reasoning behind architectural choices, and observations from training and evaluation. I aim to balance theoretical curiosity with practical insight, ensuring that this work is not only exploratory but also applicable.

This repository reflects an ongoing journey through the evolving landscape of multi-modal ML. Whether you're a fellow researcher, student, or practitioner interested in data fusion, cross-modal learning, or advanced model architectures, I hope you find these resources helpful.

Feedback, collaboration, and open discussion are always welcome. Multi-modal learning is a rapidly growing field, and there's much to explore, refine, and build together.
